### Bill of materials:
* 1 Arduino Uno (we will use it for programming ESP8266)
* 2 ESP8266 01
* 3 DHT 22 (Temperature and Humidity sensor)
* 4 DS18B20 (waterproof verson to measure soil temperature in my case)
* 5 Two small maket boards
* 6 Pull-Up resistor 5 kOhm or (4.7 kOhm you can also use it)
* 7 Wires mother-mother and father-mother to connect
* 8 Supply board 3.3V -5V 
* 9 Electric montage box ( I use IP65 100x100x70)
* 10 AC/DC Adapter for supply board
* 11 Screw for DHT 22
#### Also you need:
* Screwdriver
* Nippers
* Soldering iron
* Heat shrink
* Drill 
* Sharp knife
